# Test configuration
#
# This project uses Playwright for browser testing.
# Playwright tests are in the playwright-tests/ directory.
#
# IMPORTANT: Use "bun run test" to run tests (not "bun test")
# - "bun test" runs Bun's built-in test runner which is incompatible with Playwright
# - "bun run test" runs the npm script which correctly invokes Playwright
#
# If you create Bun-native tests in the future, use the .test.ts extension
# and place them outside the playwright-tests/ directory to avoid conflicts.
